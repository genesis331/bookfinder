# BookFinder Website

BookFinder, just as the name suggests, is an interface where users can use to look up books with keywords or ISBN. This project is an open-source project with the combination of:

* [Current Repository](https://github.com/genesis331/bookfinder) (website)
* [BookFinder API Repository](https://github.com/genesis331/bookfinderapi) (API)

## How To Use

1. Click on [this link](https://bookfinder.zixucheah331.ml/) and the Search Page opens up. 
    * You may enter the name of the book (or some keywords on the name of book).
    * You can also search with the book's ISBN.
2. When the result loads, click on the [**`Read More`**]() button to view the descriptions and more details on the book. 
    * You may also download a copy of the book in that page.
